# Science Communication Gallery

Welcome to my gallery of science communication visuals. Find logos that I've created for various software programs as well as engaging visuals that help simplify complex data. I primarily utilize Adobe Illustrator, but I also use other visualization tools including:
- Canva (Free and paid versions)
- BioRender (Free with Institutional Access)
- ggplot2, an R package (Free)

If youâ€™d like to collaborate or learn more, please reach out [via email](https://swi1.github.io/SMG.Wilson/contact/).


## Logos
![Three trees and a dendrogram with taxaHFE in white text](images/taxaHFE_logo.png)

![Four foods in a row, with two of the same food connected by a white line](images/FoodMapper_logo_final.png)

## Schematics
![Contains a photo of beans, a photo of someone holding receipts, and someone holding a small plant with gloved hands](images/AIFS_2024_Schematic.png)

Feedback loop between nutrition/diet, optimization of diet and consumer costs, and the molecular breeding of foods. 

![schematic showing how eating polyphenols can influence human health](images/Polyphenol_Impact.png) 

Simple schematic displaying how the polyphenols we consume can undergo microbial metabolism and generate phenolic derivatives. These phenolic derivatives can often have greater impacts on the health outcomes than the original compound. Created in BioRender.
